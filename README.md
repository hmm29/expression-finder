# expression-finder

This program finds an expression that evaluates to a value, using exactly four operands and up to four arithmetic operators. It was a quick code project inspired by the Introduction of Hacking: The Art of Exploitation (Second Edition) by Jon Erickson.

The given problem was the following:

"Use each of the numbers 1,3,4, and 6 exactly once with any of the four basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to total 24. Each number must be used once and only once, and you may define the order of operations; for example, 3 * (4 + 6) + 1 = 31 is valid, however incorrect, since it doesn't total 24."

I initially guessed that there was no solution, but I really wanted to make sure that my answer was correct, so I coded up this program. It works for all inputs of four numbers, uses the four arithmetic operators, and knows how to apply order of operations. I had fun making this too.
